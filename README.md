# Football Regression

This is my first Metis project, where I am trying to predict NFL lifetime achievement using college stats. 

For my final presentation, see [here](https://github.com/leaferickson/Football_Regression/blob/master/Football%20Regression%20Analysis.pdf).

For QB's, I used lifetime passer rating (minimum 50 passes thrown) to evaluate value. For recievers and running backs I came up with my own valuation formula, which can be seen at the end of the presentation.
